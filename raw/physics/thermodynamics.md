# Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is a branch of science concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work.


## Laws of Thermodynamics

 0. "If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law helps define the notion of temperature." 
 1. When energy passes, as work, as heat, or with matter, into or out from a system, the system's internal energy changes in accord with the law of conservation of energy.
 2. In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases.
 3. The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
