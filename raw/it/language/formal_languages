Language | L := ‖ ba babb aab


Production Rules
S → aS



Chomsky-Hierarchy

Chomsky 0: At least one non-terminal on the left
	α → β

Chomsky 1 (= context sensitive): 
	More or equal symbols on the right than on the left.
	Thus, a word cannot become shorter by applying a production step
	αAβ → αγβ

Chomsky 2 (context free): Exactly one non-terminal on the left, nothing else
	Thus, a production rule does not depend on previous symbols
	A → γ

Chomsky 3 (regular): only one symbol on the left and the right.
	A → a | A → B
